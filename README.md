# Wine and Proton tkg repository

i forked it and edit for auto-deploy wine or proton to releases
because nix (slo-shit) cant fetch artifacts((( im so tired

when u create another tag it:

1. starts building
2. archives to tar.zst (i suppose)
3. push to release with tag (i think u understoo me dude)
